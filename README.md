# Road Anomaly Detection, Classification and Mapping - RADCM

## Some basic directory structure
All the android app stuff will go in App/   
All the backend stuff, including django folders and all the ml stuff too, will go in Server/  
All the code to be run on the mpu6050 module will go in Mpu6050Module/  
... you get the idea
